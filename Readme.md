In order to complete the project there are five scripts 
 1. script1.R : Read the data project file,set the properluformta to a "Date" and         "Time" colummns. The script makes a subset between the  2007-02-01 and 
    2007-02-02,acording the project instrucctions,so optimized  system memory             requirements. Create: "data1.txt" to be loaded for each plot script.
    
 2. plot1.R,plot2.R,plot3.R and plot4.R. Each of them plots one type of graphic.
 
 3. plot1.png,plot2.png,plot3.png and plot4.png. Output of each and corresponding        previos R scripts
